# webrtc-ip

Visit [http://n3a9.github.io/webrtc-ip](http://n3a9.github.io/webrtc-ip) in your browser to see a working demonstration.

## Background

This website will use [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) to scan and show you your IP addresses. This also has the ability to detect anonymized local IP addresses, namely generated by an experimental feature of Chrome.

## Chrome Flags

An experimental feature of Chrome is to automatically anonymize local IPs exposed by WebRTC. To be able to retrieve the local IP address, you must disable this feature.

Go to [chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns](chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns) in your Chrome browser to disable.
